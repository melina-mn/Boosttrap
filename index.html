          <p>
            Dior was born in Granville, 
            a seaside town on the coast 
            of Normandy, France. He was 
            the second of five children 
            born to Maurice Dior, a wealthy 
            fertilizer manufacturer 
            (the family firm was Dior Frères), 
            and his wife, formerly Madeleine Martin. 
            He had four siblings: Raymond 
            (father of Françoise Dior), Jacqueline, 
            Bernard, and Catherine Dior. When Christian 
            was about five years old, the family 
            moved to Paris, but still returned to 
            the Normandy coast for summer holidays.
            Dior's family had hoped he would become 
            a diplomat, but Dior wished to be 
            involved in art. To make money, 
            he sold his fashion sketches outside 
            his house for about 10 cents each 
            ($2 in 2022 dollars). In 1928, he left 
            school and received money from his father 
            to finance a small art gallery, where he and 
            a friend sold art by the likes of Pablo Picasso. 
            The gallery was closed three years later, following 
            the deaths of Dior's mother and brother, as well as 
            financial trouble during the Great Depression that 
            resulted in his father losing control of the family 
            business.[citation needed] Dior had no choice but 
            to find another source of income to support himself.

            Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel was born in 1883 
            to Eugénie Jeanne Devolle Chanel, known as 
            Jeanne, a laundrywoman, in the charity hospital 
            run by the Sisters of Providence (a poorhouse) 
            in Saumur, Maine-et-Loire. She was Jeanne's second 
            child with Albert Chanel; the first, Julia, had been
            born less than a year earlier. Albert Chanel was 
            an itinerant street vendor who peddled work 
            clothes and undergarments, living a nomadic life, 
            traveling to and from market towns. The family 
            resided in run-down lodgings. In 1884, he married 
            Jeanne Devolle, persuaded to legitimate his 
            children by her family who had "united, 
            effectively, to pay Albert". At birth, 
            Chanel's name was entered into the 
            official registry as "Chasnel". Jeanne was 
            too unwell to attend the registration, and 
            Albert was registered as "traveling".
            With both parents absent, the infant's last 
            name was misspelled, probably due to a clerical 
            error. She went to her grave as Gabrielle Chasnel 
            because to correct, legally, the misspelled name 
            on her birth certificate would reveal that she was 
            born in a poor house hospice. The couple had six
            children—Julia, Gabrielle, Alphonse (the first boy, 
            born 1885), Antoinette (born 1887), Lucien, and Augustin 
            (who died at six months)[13]—and lived crowded into a 
            one-room lodging in the town of Brive-la-Gaillarde.

          <p>
            Guccio Gucci was born in Florence, 
            Tuscany on 26 March 1881. He was 
            the son of Tuscan parents, Gabriello
            Gucci, a leather craftsman from San 
            Miniato, and Elena Santini, from Lastra 
            a Signa. As a teenager, in 1899, Guccio 
            Gucci worked at the Savoy Hotel in London.
            Little is known about his early life circumstances 
            and what influenced his move to London.
            Gucci was inspired by the elegant upper-class
            hotel guests and by luggage companies such as 
            H.J. Cave & Sons. He returned to Florence and 
            started making luxury luggage and accessories.
